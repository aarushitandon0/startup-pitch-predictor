# Startup Pitch Predictor

A machine learning-powered web app that predicts whether a startup pitch will receive funding ‚Äî based on the pitch text, requested amount, and startup category. Built with scikit-learn and Streamlit, it's a fast, interactive tool for entrepreneurs, investors, or curious minds.

##  What It Does

-  Takes in a startup's elevator pitch
-  Asks how much funding you're requesting
-  Takes your startup category (tech, health, edu, etc.)
- Predicts whether you'd get funding or not
-  Shows prediction instantly in a user-friendly interface

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- pandas / numpy / joblib
- TF-IDF Vectorizer for NLP
